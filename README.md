# danhanco-CSCI24000-final-project

Howdy!

This is my final project, there are 6 files in this project that are missing due to me not being allowed to push them because 
of the file permissions but if you need to run the bot I could work with you to get around any problems.

The path to the work I did is as follows. src/main/java/me/danielhancock/finalbot EVERYTHING IN THIS FOLDER IS UNIQUE CODE.

The challenge in this code was honestly learning to integrate with different systems. I've never worked with API's, neither have 
I ever worked with development kits or keys or servers, before I even got to the code I had spent about 10 hours on figuring out 
how to set up the bot in the first place entirely, because it's an entire system, but now I could replicate it.

Other than that, enjoy the bot! I changed from my original mission, because involving the YouTube and Google API would've been a 
whole other battle that I just simply did not have the original knowledge to tackle in time for this project. However, I did still
implement some difficult code and put a lot of work into this that I'm proud of and I will implement these in future bots.
